# TAHub Contacts User Guide

If you are a busy Computer Science student juggling Teaching Assistant roles and
struggling to keep track of your many
students, *TAHub Contacts* is a desktop application for you to easily manage your
student contact details!

<box type="tip" theme="light">
<md>
    While it has a *GUI* (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions
    happen using a *CLI* (Command Line Interface) with typed commands. A perfect
    fit if youâ€™re already a wizard at the keyboard.

## Quick start :rocket:

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for your AddressBook.
   - Make sure that this folder is **empty**.
4. Open a command terminal
   ([Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089) |
   [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) |
   [Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)), `cd` into the folder
   you put the jar file in, and
   use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app
   contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g.
   typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - `list` : Lists all contacts.

   - `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   - `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   - `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   - `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features :computer:) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features :computer:

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format: :fa-solid-lightbulb:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`
  etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`
  is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as
  `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and
  pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding
  line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Editing the data file

and `[JAR file location]/data/courselist.json`
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAHub Contacts will
discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is
recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause TAHub Contacts to behave in unexpected ways
(e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the
data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[Future]`

*TBC :D*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ :grey_question:

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file
it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAHub Contacts home
folder.

**Q**: I accidentally performed the wrong command. Is there a way for me to
revert the change?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, we have not implemented an undo command for TAHub contacts.
:pensive:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues :bug:

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary
   screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open
   off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by
   the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use
   the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help
   Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The
   remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
